| [Lab 1](./lab_1.md) | Exploring the SOCKS5 proxy protocol with a set of tools and Dante SOCKS5 server. At the end we have a complete specification for it. |
| [Lab 2](./lab_2.md) | Implementing a simple SOCKS5 message in Go with tests. Sets the standard for implementing all messages.                              |
| [Lab 3](./lab_3.md) | Implementing a client capable of connecting to SOCKS5 proxy via the CONNECT command. Testing against Dante server.                   |
| [Lab 4](./lab_4.md) | Adding the BIND command to the client. Testing against Dante server.                                                                 |
| [Lab 5](./lab_5.md) | Adding the UDP ASSOCIATE command to the client. Testing against Dante server.                                                        |
| [Lab 6](./lab_6.md) | Creating SOCKS5 server capable of accepting clients with NoAuth(anonymous) and handling the CONNECT command.                         |
| [Lab 7](./lab_7.md) | Extending the server to support BIND command.                                                                                        |
| [Lab 8](./lab_8.md) | Extending the server to support UDP ASSOCIATE command.                                                                               |
